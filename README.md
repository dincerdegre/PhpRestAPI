# Basic Php REST API

If Php and Composer Installed your system, You need to execute <code>composer install</code> and serve for development purpose

``` 
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t ./
```

Add .env file in root folder

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=main
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

I didnt make Database connection or Auth. This project only gives static answers. Basic API Structure can be changed and use another project.

> I make Nodejs APIs but i want to say Hi my old friend Php :-)
